# System Analysis and Design Portfolio Submission

## Reflection: DriverPass Project

The DriverPass project was developed for a client who needed a system to help users prepare for their driving tests. The system included features for scheduling driving lessons, accessing learning modules, and tracking progress. The goal was to create a secure and user-friendly platform that met the client’s business needs.

One aspect I did particularly well was gathering and documenting the business requirements. I ensured that the client’s goals were clearly understood and translated into actionable system features. My system design document also effectively outlined the architecture and flow of the application.

If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve the visual elements of the system design document. Adding more diagrams, such as user journey maps and data flow diagrams, would make the design easier to understand and more engaging.

To interpret the user’s needs, I relied on user stories, feedback, and direct communication with the client. This helped me prioritize features that were most important to the end users. Considering user needs is essential in system design because it ensures the final product is functional, intuitive, and valuable.

My approach to designing software involves breaking down requirements into use cases, creating UML diagrams, and iterating based on feedback. In future projects, I plan to use agile methodologies and early prototyping to refine designs more effectively and ensure alignment with user expectations.
